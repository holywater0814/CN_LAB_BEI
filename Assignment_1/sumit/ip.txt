ip address: 192.168.1.80
network mask: 255.255.255.0
network address:192.168.1.0
broadcast :192.168.1.255
 
Total number of end devices that my network can support can be calculated by using subnet mask. Network bits = 24 host bits = 8 hence supported end devices = 2^8-2=254. 
We subtracted 2 because one of the address is network address and where first 8 bits from right hand side will all be 0 and of the address is broadcasting address where first 8 bits will be all 1 .
