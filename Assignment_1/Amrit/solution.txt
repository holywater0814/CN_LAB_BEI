Ip address          : 192.168.1.82
Subnet Mask         : 0xffffff00 or /24
Network address     : 192.168.1.0
Broadcast address   :  192.168.1.255


Total number of end devices that my network can support can be calculated by using 
subnet mask. 
Network bits = 24
host bits    = 8 
hence supported end devices = 2^8-2=254
We subtracted 2 because one of the address is network address and where first 8
bits from right hand side will all be 0 and of the address is broadcasting address
where first 8 bits will be all 1 .
